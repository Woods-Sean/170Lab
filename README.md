Prototype & Playtest Evaluation
The Prototype & Playtest Evaluation is a written report documenting the basics of your game design, your initial prototype, and the playtesting process. Because each game design’s methods and goals are different, there is no minimum length requirement, but your Evaluation report should at least include the information below, organized into four categories:

Project Overview (8 points)

Game (Working) Title
Team Members & Roles
1-Sentence Game Description
Genre/Style
Number of Players
Target Platform
Target Player/Audience
High Concept Information (12 points)

What does the player do? (interactivity)
Why do they do it? (player motivation)
Where does the player do it? (setting, story, narration)
What are the constraints on the player? (primary mechanics)
What sort of emotion is this game trying to evoke in the player? (affect)
What differentiates your game from others of its type? (defining elements and competitive analysis)
Prototype Overview (20 points)

What aspect of your game is your prototype intended to model?
Written, organized, and edited rules
Photos/screenshots of prototype
Photos of people playing prototype (Please be cognizant of the ethical/legal implications of photographing your playtesters. If you plan to use them publically—e.g., for a portfolio or website—be sure to ask for written consent. Otherwise, blur or crop faces. Always ask before taking photos.)
Prototype & Playtest Analysis (20 points)

What questions about your design were you seeking to answer with the prototype?
Who playtested your prototype?
How did you collect data on people playing the prototype (observation, questionnaires, interviews, etc.)?
Which questions about your design did you answer during playtesting?  
Which questions about your design still remain after playtesting?
What new questions about your design did you develop after playtesting?
What player comments did you find interesting or useful?
Do you think your prototype is worth developing into a full game?
Though you may include intra-team playtest notes in your report, you must conduct at least two playtests with participants outside your team, and one of those two playtests must be with participants outside of 170 (e.g., friends, family, baristas, dentists, etc.).

Please upload a PDF of your Prototype & Playtest Evaluation to Canvas by 11:59PM Tuesday. Only one Evaluation Report is required per team, so please be sure to list all of your team members for this block.
